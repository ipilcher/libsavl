# libSAVL

Simple AVL tree library

## Introduction

libSAVL is a simple, lightweight, low-level
[AVL tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) implementation for use in C
programs.

## Building and installing the library

### RPM-based systems

On RPM-based systems (Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, etc.), the
recommended way to install the library is to build RPMs.  First, download the
`tar.gz` version of the most recent tag from
[this page](https://github.com/ipilcher/libsavl/tags).  Save the file in your
`~/rpmbuild/SOURCES` directory.

The RPMs can now be built "locally," with the `rpmbuild` command.  For example:

```
$ rpmbuild -tb ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/libsavl-0.7.0.tar.gz
︙
Wrote: /home/pilcher/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/libsavl-devel-0.7.0-3.fc35.x86_64.rpm
Wrote: /home/pilcher/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/libsavl-debuginfo-0.7.0-3.fc35.x86_64.rpm
Wrote: /home/pilcher/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/libsavl-0.7.0-3.fc35.x86_64.rpm
Wrote: /home/pilcher/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/libsavl-debugsource-0.7.0-3.fc35.x86_64.rpm
Wrote: /home/pilcher/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/libsavl-doc-0.7.0-3.fc35.x86_64.rpm
︙
+ exit 0
```

Alternatively, the `mock` command can be used to build the RPMs in an isolated,
clean environment.  (`mock` can also be used to build `i686` packages on
`x86_64` platforms or to build packages for older distributions.  For example,
`mock` can be used to build CentOS 7 packages on Fedora 35.

```
$ cat /etc/fedora-release
Fedora release 35 (Thirty Five)

$ rpmbuild -ts ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/libsavl-0.7.0.tar.gz

$ mock -r centos-7-x86_64 /home/pilcher/rpmbuild/SRPMS/libsavl-0.7.0-3.fc35.src.rpm
︙

INFO: Results and/or logs in: /var/lib/mock/centos-7-x86_64/result
Finish: run
```

Once the packages have been built, install them with the usual package manager,
`yum`, `dnf`, etc.

#### Development/debug RPMs

This repository also contains a second SPEC file, `libsavl-dev.spec~` which can
be used to easily build RPMs from the repository working directory.  (The `~`
character at the end of the file name is required for the `rpmbuild -t...` to
work.)  This SPEC file, when used from within the repository directory,
automatically detects the latest tag and uses that tag as the package version.

For example:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ipilcher/libsavl.git
Cloning into 'libsavl'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 48, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (44/44), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (33/33), done.

Receiving objects: 100% (48/48), 58.61 KiB | 1.30 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (17/17), done.

$ cd libsavl

$ # Make sure Git doesn't change the SPEC file during the build
$ cp libsavl-dev.spec~ libsavl-dev.spec

$ rpmbuild -bb libsavl-dev.spec
︙
+ git checkout v0.7.0
Note: switching to 'v0.7.0'.
︙
+ git checkout main

```

This SPEC file builds the library without optimizations (`-O0`) to make
debugging easier.

### Manually building and installing

If needed, determine the latest Git tag.

```
$ git describe --tags --abbrev=0
v0.7.0
```

The full version of the library (`${VERSION}` below) is the tag without its
leading "v", `0.7.0` in this case.  The "`${SO_VERSION}`" is the full version
without its final component, `0.7` in this case.

Build the library.

```
$ gcc -std=gnu99 -O3 -Wall -Wextra -shared -fPIC \
	-Wl,-soname,libsavl.so.${SO_VERSION} -o libsavl.so.${VERSION} savl.c
```

Copy the library to your distribution's standard location (usually `/usr/lib`
or `/usr/lib64`, refered to as `${LIB_DIR}` below), create the required symbolic
links, and run `ldconfig`.

```
$ sudo cp libsavl.so.${VERSION} ${LIB_DIR}
$ sudo ldconfig
```

If development files are required, install the header file and the unversioned
library link.

```
$ sudo cp savl.h /usr/include/
$ sudo ln -s cp libsavl.so.${VERSION} ${LIB_DIR}/libsavl.so
```
